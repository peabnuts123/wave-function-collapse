# Wave Function Collapse

Learning about the [Wave Function Collapse](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse) algorithm by implementing it myself. Currently works relatively well. Takes a crafted list of "tiles" and collapses them across a grid. Currently rendered in terminal using colour control characters.
